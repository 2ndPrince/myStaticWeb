# myStaticWeb
This page is obsolete and replaced by wordpress blog (arcanumysl.wordpress.com)

Source codes for my web are here.
I created this page for personal blog usage.
Like many other sites, index.html was the first page entering the web.
It clearly navigates to wherever you would like to visit(such as about, contact, resume, project portfolio, personal learning postings)

I built this page from scratch using HTML and CSS techniques.
It was enough exercise to taste how web looks like.
More study(if I wanted to) might include: JS and its various frameworks syncing with backend server for a complete web application.

No more updates will be done as I am studying data science.
